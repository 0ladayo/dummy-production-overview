## Production Overview Project

> Inspired by this [demo](https://dash.gallery/ddk-oil-and-gas-demo/), I collaborated to build a production overview dashboard from scratch

> The dashboard serves as a source of information where historical data about wells and the field can be obtained at ease from inception

### Languages (Libraries) and Tools Used

#### Google Cloud Storage (GCS)

> google cloud storage was used to store the collected data.

#### Pandas

> pandas library in python was used to access the data stored in GCS.

#### Plotly 

> plotly library in python was used for the data visualization 

#### Dash

> dash library in python was used to build the interactive web framework.

#### Google App Engine (GAE)

> google app engine was used to deploy the main.py file.

### Output

> the final output can be see via the link below

> [Production Overview Dashboard](https://dummy-production-overview.nw.r.appspot.com/)

### Note

> because of data privacy policy, the actual wells data have been replaced with randomly generated data
